Extra Credit - Deployment

Using Serverless:

We can use the AWS S3, Lambda, RDS

1) We can split the two API endpoints and store the code in two Different Lambda functions that are connected to Amazon RDS to fetch Data
2) We can use s3 buckets to store or upload new data files
3) we can write another Lambda function which gets triggered when a new file is uploaded on given bucket to ingest the data into Amazon RDS and calculate the Averages



Using VMs:

We can use AWS ec2, RDS, S3

1) We can deploy the application on an EC2 Instance and connect it to RDS service or deploy a sql server on the VM itself.
2) we can upload the data files to bucket and wrte a cron job to fetch and Ingest Data and calculate Averages.
